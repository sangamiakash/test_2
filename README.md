# HelperHub

HelperHub is a rapid concept prototype built for a lightning design-thinking exercise. The scenario: you are remotely helping Auntie Mary book her COVID booster at Walgreens and want tooling that makes the help-giving feel calm, clear, and collaborative.

## Features

- **Live session dashboard** to capture who you are helping, the shared goal, and important call links.
- **Guided checklists** for co-creating step-by-step instructions that can be checked off in real time.
- **Resource library** to stash helpful links or add curated suggestions with one tap.
- **Notes & recap** panel to capture insights and export the session summary as plain text.
- **Micro-interactions** such as quick action chips and toasts that reinforce momentum.
